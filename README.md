# Advertisement-and-Sales-Predication
This project involves building a linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising spending in TV, radio, and newspaper. The dataset used for this analysis is named "Advertising.csv."

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between advertising spending in different media channels (TV, radio, and newspaper) and the resulting product sales. The project includes data exploration, assumption checking for linear regression, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### Requirements
- Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is "Advertising.csv." It contains information about advertising spending in three different media channels (TV, radio, and newspaper) and the corresponding sales figures.

### Model Building
- Linear regression is chosen as the predictive modeling algorithm.
- The data is split into training and testing sets.
- Features are scaled using Min-Max scaling.
- A linear regression model is trained on the training set.
- Model coefficients, intercept, and performance metrics are analyzed.
